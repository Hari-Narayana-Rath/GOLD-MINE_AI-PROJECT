# üèÜ Gold Mine Game AI with Optimal Path Visualization

[Live Demo on Streamlit Cloud](https://gold-mine-ai-project.streamlit.app)

An interactive web application that simulates a miner traversing an \(n \times m\) gold-mine grid to collect the maximum possible gold. Built with Python, Streamlit for the front-end, and a combination of propositional logic and dynamic programming under the hood.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Grid Input**: Enter your gold-mine matrix manually or upload a JSON file.  
- **Dynamic Programming Table**: View the DP matrix showing the maximum gold collectible from each cell.  
- **Optimal Path Highlighting**: The chosen path is overlaid on the grid with step numbers and gold values.  
- **Step-by-Step Move List**: See exactly which moves the miner takes and how much gold is picked up at each step.  
- **One-Click Deployment**: Easily clone and deploy on Streamlit Cloud or any standard Python environment.

## üß† Algorithms & Methodology

### 1. Propositional Logic Mapping
- State Representation: Each state in the DP can be mapped to a logical variable that represents the status of the gold mine at that point, such as whether a cell is empty, contains gold, or is visited. The state transition depends on actions like moving between cells or collecting gold.

- Action Constraints: Propositional logic can be used to define valid actions at each state. For instance, you can use logical operators to enforce constraints on the agent‚Äôs movements‚Äîsuch as only being able to move to adjacent cells or collect gold if there is any available in the current state.

- Goal Condition: The final goal in the DP problem (maximizing gold collection) can be defined as a propositional formula representing the desired end state. This might include conditions like having reached a specific location or collected a certain amount of gold, which can be checked through propositional logic expressions.
### 2. Dynamic Programming Solver
- **Initialization**: In the last column `j = m-1`, set `dp[i][m-1] = gold[i][m-1]` for each row \(i\).  
- **Backward Fill**: Iterate columns from right to left, computing `dp[i][j]` via the above recurrence.  
- **Result**: The maximum gold collectible is \(\max_i \, dp[i][0]\).
This guarantees \(O(n \times m)\) time complexity and \(O(n \times m)\) space.
### 3. Path Reconstruction & Visualization

- While filling `dp`, we also track a `path` array storing, for each \((i,j)\), the next cell that leads to that maximum.  
- After filling, we start from the row \(r\) with the largest `dp[r][0]` and follow the stored pointers to reconstruct the sequence of moves.  
- The Streamlit UI overlays this path on the grid, highlights each visited cell, and prints a step-by-step list with the gold collected at each move.
